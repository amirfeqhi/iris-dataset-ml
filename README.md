## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to the Iris dataset, a classic dataset often used for introductory data science and classification tasks. It provides a practical example for understanding and implementing two different classification methods: Logistic Regression and Feed Forward Neural Network.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Methods

### 1. Logistic Regression

In the `logistic_regression.ipynb` notebook, you'll find the implementation of Logistic Regression to classify Iris flowers based on their features. Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm, and this notebook serves as an introduction to its usage in machine learning.

### 2. Feed Forward Neural Network

In the `neural_network.ipynb` notebook, you'll find the implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a neural network for Iris flower classification, showcasing the power of deep learning.
